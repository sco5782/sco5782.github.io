    <h2>
        What is Sanrio?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sanrio is a Japanese company that specializes in making cute characters and merchandise. 
        They were founded in 1960 and have been going strong, creating new characters, pop-up shops, and even amusement parks.
        Sanrio had such a big impact, not only did it shape Japanese culture, but American culture as well.
        You might have seen a cute little cat with a bow on clothes or makeup. That's Hello Kitty, Sanrio's most recognizable mascot!
        While she is the face of the company, there are many more characters who are just as cute. 
        Here we will go over the most popular ones and showcase their different personalities and styles.

    <h2>Character Information</h2>
    <p>
        Hello Kitty's design came about when Shintaro Tsuji, founder of Sanrio, began selling rubber sandals with flowers painted on them.
        He noticed that profits went up just by having a cute design on them, and hired Yuko Shimizu to create a character for his products.
        From there Hello Kitty became one of the most recognizable mascots in Japan. She has been featured in almost everything Sanrio-related,
        from merchandise to games, even to anime. She is good at baking cookies and loves Mama's homemade apple pie. 
        She also likes to collect cute things and her favorite subjects in school are English, music, and art.

        He works at Cafe Cinnamon and though he is quite shy, he likes to take naps on customers' laps.

    <p>
        Aggrestuko is a small red panda office worker who debuted in 2016.
        She is one of the few Sanrio characters to have an entire TV series dedicated to her and her story.
        Unlike other Sanrio characters, she is marketed toward adults and meant to represent the working class of Japan.
        She suffers from depression and stress from her office job and often goes out for death metal karaoke by herself to release her rage.
        Aggretsuko keeps this a secret from her co-workers as she views it as embarrassing or unladylike.
